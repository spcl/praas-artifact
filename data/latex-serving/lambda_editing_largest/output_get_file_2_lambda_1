{"path":"secs","file":"core.tex","data":"ACM's consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides a\nconsistent \\LaTeX\\ style for use across ACM publications, and\nincorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality\nnecessary for future Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and\nSIG-specific \\LaTeX\\ templates have been examined, and their unique\nfeatures incorporated into this single new template.\n\nIf you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a valuable\nguide to the process of preparing your work for publication. If you\nhave published with ACM before, this document provides insight and\ninstruction into more recent changes to the article template.\n\nThe ``\\verb|acmart|'' document class can be used to prepare articles\nfor any ACM publication --- conference or journal, and for any stage\nof publication, from review to final ``camera-ready'' copy, to the\nauthor's own version, with {\\itshape very} few changes to the source.\n\n\\section{Template Overview}\nAs noted in the introduction, the ``\\verb|acmart|'' document class can\nbe used to prepare many different kinds of documentation --- a\ndouble-blind initial submission of a full-length technical paper, a\ntwo-page SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies abstract, a ``camera-ready''\njournal article, a SIGCHI Extended Abstract, and more --- all by\nselecting the appropriate {\\itshape template style} and {\\itshape\n  template parameters}.\n\nThis document will explain the major features of the document\nclass. For further information, the {\\itshape \\LaTeX\\ User's Guide} is\navailable from\n\\url{https:\/\/www.acm.org\/publications\/proceedings-template}.\n\n\\subsection{Template Styles}\n\nThe primary parameter given to the ``\\verb|acmart|'' document class is\nthe {\\itshape template style} which corresponds to the kind of publication\nor SIG publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square\nbrackets and is a part of the {\\verb|documentclass|} command:\n\\begin{verbatim}\n  \\documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}\n\\end{verbatim}\n\nJournals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM journals\nuse the {\\verb|acmsmall|} template style:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item {\\texttt{acmsmall}}: The default journal template style.\n\\item {\\texttt{acmlarge}}: Used by JOCCH and TAP.\n\\item {\\texttt{acmtog}}: Used by TOG.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe majority of conference proceedings documentation will use the {\\verb|acmconf|} template style.\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item {\\texttt{acmconf}}: The default proceedings template style.\n\\item{\\texttt{sigchi}}: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.\n\\item{\\texttt{sigplan}}: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Template Parameters}\n\nIn addition to specifying the {\\itshape template style} to be used in\nformatting your work, there are a number of {\\itshape template parameters}\nwhich modify some part of the applied template style. A complete list\nof these parameters can be found in the {\\itshape \\LaTeX\\ User's Guide.}\n\nFrequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item {\\texttt{anonymous,review}}: Suitable for a ``double-blind''\n  conference submission. Anonymizes the work and includes line\n  numbers. Use with the \\texttt{\\acmSubmissionID} command to print the\n  submission's unique ID on each page of the work.\n\\item{\\texttt{authorversion}}: Produces a version of the work suitable\n  for posting by the author.\n\\item{\\texttt{screen}}: Produces colored hyperlinks.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThis document uses the following string as the first command in the\nsource file:\n\\begin{verbatim}\n\\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n\\section{Modifications}\n\nModifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting\nmargins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,\nand the use of the \\verb|\\vspace| command to manually adjust the\nvertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not allowed.\n\n{\\bfseries Your document will be returned to you for revision if\n  modifications are discovered.}\n\n\\section{Typefaces}\n\nThe ``\\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the\n``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \\TeX\\ installation should include\nthis set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The\n``\\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\\verb|ltimes|'' packages should not be used,\nas they will override the built-in typeface families.\n\n\\section{Title Information}\n\nThe title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -\n\\url{https:\/\/capitalizemytitle.com\/} has useful rules for\ncapitalization. Use the {\\verb|title|} command to define the title of\nyour work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the\n{\\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.\n\nIf your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used\nin the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \\verb|title|\ncommand has a ``short title'' parameter:\n\\begin{verbatim}\n  \\title[short title]{full title}\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n\\section{Authors and Affiliations}\n\\input{secs\/authors}\n\n\\section{Rights Information}\n\nAuthors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a rights\nform. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice\nmade by the author, this may be copyright transfer, permission,\nlicense, or an OA (open access) agreement.\n\nRegardless of the rights management choice, the author will receive a\ncopy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This\nform contains \\LaTeX\\ commands that must be copied into the source\ndocument. When the document source is compiled, these commands and\ntheir parameters add formatted text to several areas of the final\ndocument:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item the ``ACM Reference Format'' text on the first page.\n\\item the ``rights management'' text on the first page.\n\\item the conference information in the page header(s).\n\\end{itemize}\n\nRights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing several\nworks for an event, make sure to use the correct set of commands with\neach of the works.\n\nThe ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over one\npage in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).\n\n\\section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}\n\nTwo elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful\ntaxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online\nsearch.\n\nThe ACM Computing Classification System ---\n\\url{https:\/\/www.acm.org\/publications\/class-2012} --- is a set of\nclassifiers and concepts that describe the computing\ndiscipline. Authors can select entries from this classification\nsystem, via \\url{https:\/\/dl.acm.org\/ccs\/ccs.cfm}, and generate the\ncommands to be included in the \\LaTeX\\ source.\n\nUser-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases\nof the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing\nthe research being presented.\n\nCCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all\narticles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and\ntwo-page articles (or abstracts).\n\n\\section{Sectioning Commands}\n\nYour work should use standard \\LaTeX\\ sectioning commands:\n\\verb|section|, \\verb|subsection|, \\verb|subsubsection|, and\n\\verb|paragraph|. They should be numbered; do not remove the numbering\nfrom the commands.\n\nSimulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of\na paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\\bfseries not allowed.}\n\n\\section{Tables}\n\nThe ``\\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\\verb|booktabs|''\npackage --- \\url{https:\/\/ctan.org\/pkg\/booktabs} --- for preparing\nhigh-quality tables.\n\nTable captions are placed {\\itshape above} the table.\n\nBecause tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for\nthem is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To\nensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the\nenvironment \\textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the\ntable caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the\n\\textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and\ncolumns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,\ndetailed instructions on \\textbf{tabular} material are found in the\n\\textit{\\LaTeX\\ User's Guide}.\n\nImmediately following this sentence is the point at which\nTable~\\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the\nplacement of the table here with the table in the printed output of\nthis document.\n\n\\begin{table}\n  \\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}\n  \\label{tab:freq}\n  \\begin{tabular}{ccl}\n    \\toprule\n    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\\\\n    \\midrule\n    \\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\\\\n    $\\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\\\\n    \\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\\\\n    $\\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\\\\n  \\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nTo set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's\nlive area, use the environment \\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's\ncontents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this\nwide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more\ndesirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which\nTable~\\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is\ninstructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table\nin the printed output of this document.\n\n\\begin{table*}\n  \\caption{Some Typical Commands}\n  \\label{tab:commands}\n  \\begin{tabular}{ccl}\n    \\toprule\n    Command &A Number & Comments\\\\\n    \\midrule\n    \\texttt{{\\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\\\\n    \\texttt{{\\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\\\\n    \\texttt{{\\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n  \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table*}\n\nAlways use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and\nuse it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to\nrecognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables\nmore easily.\n\n\\section{Math Equations}\nYou may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:\ninline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are\ndiscussed in the next sections.\n\n\\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}\nA formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or\nin-text formula.  It is produced by the \\textbf{math} environment,\nwhich can be invoked with the usual\n\\texttt{{\\char'134}begin\\,\\ldots{\\char'134}end} construction or with\nthe short form \\texttt{\\$\\,\\ldots\\$}. You can use any of the symbols\nand structures, from $\\alpha$ to $\\omega$, available in\n\\LaTeX~\\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few\nexamples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:\n\\begin{math}\n  \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}x=0\n\\end{math},\nset here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when\nset in display style.  (See next section).\n\n\\subsection{Display Equations}\nA numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the\ntext and centered horizontally---is produced by the \\textbf{equation}\nenvironment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the\n\\textbf{displaymath} environment.\n\nAgain, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and\nstructures available in \\LaTeX\\@; this section will just give a couple\nof examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the\nequation, shown as an inline equation above:\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}x=0\n\\end{equation}\nNotice how it is formatted somewhat differently in\nthe \\textbf{displaymath}\nenvironment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:\n\\begin{displaymath}\n  \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} x + 1\n\\end{displaymath}\nand follow it with another numbered equation:\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}x_i=\\int_{0}^{\\pi+2} f\n\\end{equation}\njust to demonstrate \\LaTeX's able handling of numbering.\n"}
